This test checks interpolation using Wachspress coordinates for 3d cell.
Wachspress coordinates is generalized barycentric coordinates.
Interpolation is node-based.

First test - interpolation for edge, face and cell centers, where one cell is the unit cube.
Second test - interpolation in unit tetrahedron ( vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,0) ) for point (0.25,0.2,0.3)
Coefficients for the corresponding vertices are (0.25,0.2,0.3,0.25).
